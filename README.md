# mystery_machine_sound

In Spring 2017, I enrolled in Integrated Robotics Systems at Olin College.  Our semester-long project was to build the capabilities of a robot, the Mystery Machine, that could explore and map all four floors of our Academic Center by riding elevators to traverse to different floors.

I was in charge of the sound module, enabling the robot to voice a request for human assistance in calling an elevator and selecting a destination floor.  This repo contains my individual experimentation.  For Mystery Machine's full repo, see [here](https://github.com/kghite/SysRobo2017).
